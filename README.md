# PFNL-pytorch
This project rewrite [PFNL](https://github.com/psychopa4/PFNL) model by pytorch. More details about the model in the paper: <Progressive Fusion Video Super-Resolution Network via Exploiting Non-Local Spatio-Temporal Correlations>.  

The original author of this model is [psychopa4](https://github.com/psychopa4).

## About
I rewrite the PFNL model by pytorch, by contrast the original author used tensorflow.  
  
I have checked the each step from loading data to training model, the intermediate result is same with the original code.  
  
But if you find any mistake, please tell me.
